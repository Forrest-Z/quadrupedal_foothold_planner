* [Elevation_Mapping (Robot-Centric Elevation Mapping),](https://github.com/ANYbotics/elevation_mapping#citing)<br>
* [Traversability Estimation (Traversability mapping for mobile rough terrain navigation.)](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/traversability_estimation)<br>
* [kindr (kinematics and dynamics library for robotics),](http://github.com/anybotics/kindr)<br>
* [kindr_ros (ROS wrapper for kindr),](https://github.com/anybotics/kindr_ros)<br>
* [Point Cloud Library (PCL) (point cloud processing),](http://pointclouds.org/)<br>
